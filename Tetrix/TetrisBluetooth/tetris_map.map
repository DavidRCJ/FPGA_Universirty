Mapping design into LUTs...
WARNING:MapLib:864 - The following Virtex Blockram(s) is/are being retargeted to
   Virtex2 Blockram(s). This will waste 75% of Virtex2 Blockram capacity. To
   obtain better utilization, Please re-run memory generator to retarget to
   Virtex2 Blockram modules:
   RAMB4_S4_S4 symbol "RAMB4_S4_S4_inst" (output signal=DOA<3>),
   RAMB4_S8_S8 symbol "RAMB4_S8_S8_inst" (output signal=DOBt<6>),
   RAMB4_S8 symbol "textdisplay/RAMB4_S8_inst1" (output
   signal=textdisplay/cp1<7>),
   RAMB4_S8 symbol "textdisplay/RAMB4_S8_inst2" (output
   signal=textdisplay/cp0<7>)
Running directed packing...
WARNING:Pack:266 - The function generator tetrix_gamecontrol/cx_mux0000<1>1149
   failed to merge with F5 multiplexer
   tetrix_gamecontrol/cx_mux0000<1>111122_SW0.  There is a conflict for the
   FXMUX.  The design will exhibit suboptimal timing.

Design Summary

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    2
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:           291 out of   9,312    3%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             1,554 out of   9,312   16%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:            875 out of   4,656   18%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:     875 out of     875 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of     875   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       1,614 out of   9,312   17%
    Number used as logic:             1,553
    Number used as a route-thru:         60
    Number used as Shift registers:       1

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                  7 out of     232    3%
  Number of RAMB16s:                      4 out of      20   20%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     3 out of      24   12%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.61

Peak Memory Usage:  275 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  6 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   6 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.
